                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Michaela and I’m a journalism student at DePaul University on a pre-law track. I was born and raised in Bartlett, Illinois, where I discovered my passion for journalism.
                    <br><br><br>
                    All throughout high school I was in a broadcasting and film academy where I anchored the magazine and news shows. Transitioning into college, I knew that this was what I wanted to do with my life.
                    <br><br><br>
                    I’m currently writing for Chicago Star Media as an Editorial Assistant Intern and working as a File Room Clerk at the law offices of Levin and Perconti.
                    <br><br><br>
                    I decided I wanted to incorporate my interest for law with broadcast and hopefully be able to use them both in either investigative or legal reporting.
